As Lead Developer at Lansweeper, I design and scale enterprise-grade data platforms that power real-time reporting, business intelligence, and AI-driven analytics.

My responsibilities includes:

- Designing and implementing reporting and analytics solutions on top of a distributed microservices architecture using **Kafka** **Go** and Node with **TypeScript** and React for front-end interfaces.

- Managing and scaling analytical OLAP databases like **ClickHouse** and transactional databases including **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Redis**.

- Building CI/CD pipelines with tools like **CircleCi** and **ArgoCD** for automating testing/deployment and managing **AWS services** and infrastructure **with Terraform**

Beyond the technical work, I spend time mentoring other developers and documenting our learnings. I particularly enjoy writing about the challenges we solve.
